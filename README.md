My Github account is being used for my homework, and only has one repository at the moment. This repository is named dhmatthews.github.io and links to a website that is reachable by typing that repository into the search bar.
To clone my repository onto my local machine, I downloaded Github desktop onto my computer and signed into Github through it. I then selected the Clone a repository from the internet option and chose the repository named dmatthews.github.io.
